# landslide-prediction

This project, Landslide Prediction Using Machine Learning, is a web-based application designed to predict the risk of landslides based on key environmental parameters such as rainfall, humidity, and soil moisture. Using a simple yet effective weighted scoring algorithm, the system calculates a risk score to indicate whether the likelihood of a landslide is high or low. The application features an interactive and responsive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with dynamic data visualizations created using Plotly.js to display bar charts, risk gauges, and historical trends. Users can switch between light and dark modes for better accessibility and also download a detailed PDF report of the prediction using integrated jsPDF and html2canvas libraries. This tool serves as a useful prototype for early warning systems in disaster management, infrastructure planning, and environmental studies, with potential for future upgrades such as real-time data integration and the use of advanced machine learning models.
